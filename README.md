# test-repo
creating a repo noob style

1.  create repo from github
2.  download repo - git clone url-to-repo
3.  edits to file
4.  git status
5.  add file - veriy file is modified from staging are
use git add
6.  commit file for changes
7.  push to publish changes from commits to repo

# github is cool 
localhost uploads is the way to add file changes using 
the git push command to a project or repo

# notes
now I know how to push pull file from github and 
do edits changes from localhost

send files localhost -> github.com  use git push

before push, must add then commit to send to github
